# Picasso 🖌️

# Setup

Running `setup.sh` will install all Python dependencies to run all 3 networks. To colorize a video, follow the instructions on `end_to_end.sh`. 

# Known issues

1. The enhancer needs the source and processed frames to be *exactly* the same resolution or else the images will turn out sepia. 
2. Training the colorizer might have dependency issues, make sure that fastai 1.1.57 is installed.
